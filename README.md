# Smart Irrigation System Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a smart irrigation system designed for agricultural use, using machine learning to optimize water usage. The system predicts whether irrigation is required based on environmental data like temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. It promotes water conservation and supports sustainable farming practices.

## 🌾 Features

- Predicts irrigation need using supervised learning.
- Uses Random Forest Classifier for high accuracy.
- Visualizes feature importance for model interpretability.
- Easily adaptable to other farming regions or datasets.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `irrigation_smart_agriculture.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing all the logic – data loading, visualization, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: (Optional) Place your CSV files here if you want to run it locally.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🧠 ML Model

- **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- **Target Variable:** Whether irrigation is needed (binary classification)

## 📊 Dataset

This notebook assumes the data contains features like:
- `Temperature`
- `Humidity`
- `Moisture`
- `Soil Type`, etc.

If you are using your own dataset, please make sure the columns match the ones used in the notebook.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-irrigation-system.git
   cd smart-irrigation-system

2. Install required libraries:
```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
   jupyter notebook irrigation_smart_agriculture.ipynb
```

## 📈 Results
